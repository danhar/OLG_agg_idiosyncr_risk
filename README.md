Details of the model and algorithm can be found in the paper [Idiosyncratic Risk, Aggregate Risk, and the Welfare Effects of Social Security](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iere.12365), published in IER in 2019 joint with [Alexander Ludwig](https://alexander-ludwig.com/).

The outer solution routine for aggregate risk is a variant of the Krusell-Smith algorithm.
