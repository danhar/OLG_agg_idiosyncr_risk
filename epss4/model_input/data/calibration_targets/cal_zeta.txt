! This file contains the target values from the data.
! Similar baseline.txt targets, but cal zeta_std instead of del_std to the variance of consumption growth.

! Do not change the sequence of the entries in the following table.
! First column contains the value, second column the 'associated moment' (with the strongest impact), the third column a description.

0.030   zeta_std        Std. consumption growth (NIPA)
0.023	del_mean	 	Average risk-free rate (Shiller)
2.65    beta            Capital output ratio (NIPA)
0.50	pi1_delta	    Corr.(TFP, returns) (NIPA, Shiller)
